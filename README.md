SDAI is an open-source, cross-platform AI image generation client for Android and iOS. It gives you one clean mobile workflow for self-hosted Stable Diffusion servers, hosted image APIs, crowdsourced generation, platform-specific local generation where supported, and the optional SDAI Cloud provider in official store builds.

No telemetry. No lock-in to a single provider. The FOSS build remains free of nonfree monetization modules; Google Play and App Store builds can optionally use SDAI Cloud with rewarded ads and in-app purchases for app tokens.

## Project Documentation

Root-level Markdown documents:

- [Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)
- [Screenshot generation](SCREENSHOT_GENERATION.md)
- [Nightly Android builds](NIGHTLY_BUILDS.md)
- [Git workflow](GIT_WORKFLOW.md)
- [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Why SDAI

- Choose the backend that fits the moment: your own AUTOMATIC1111 or SwarmUI server, AI Horde, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Stability AI, Fal.ai, ArliAI, or local diffusion where the platform supports it.
- Generate with familiar Stable Diffusion controls: prompts, negative prompts where supported, seed, steps, CFG scale, image size, model selectors, LoRA, embeddings, and more.
- Use one shared mobile experience across Android and iOS for remote generation workflows.
- Work locally when privacy or connectivity matters with Android ONNX, MediaPipe, stable-diffusion.cpp SDXL, Android Local Diffusion PrismML Bonsai, iOS Silicon Diffusion Core ML, or iOS Silicon Diffusion PrismML Bonsai.
- Keep your creations in a local gallery with image details, zoom, sharing, native platform save flows, and zip export.
- Check local-device fit before heavy runs with the on-device benchmark, then review storage and network usage from Settings.
- Stay in control: the public project remains open source, FOSS builds stay free of nonfree monetization modules, and SDAI Cloud is optional in official store builds.

## Provider and Platform Matrix

Android builds are distributed in three flavors:

- `playstore`: Google Play build.
- `full`: full GitHub/release build.
- `foss`: F-Droid friendly build.

iOS uses the shared mobile experience with remote generation providers, Silicon Diffusion Core ML, and Silicon Diffusion PrismML Bonsai for on-device generation on supported devices. Android also exposes Local Diffusion PrismML Bonsai on builds where the native runtime is packaged, with device suitability checked through setup and benchmark flows.

## Core Workflow

### Generate

- Txt2Img for all available providers.
- Img2Img for providers that support image input.
- Inpaint for A1111-powered Img2Img.
- Prompt tagging, optional advanced controls, seed handling, steps, CFG scale, size controls, and provider-specific model options.

### Save and Review

- Local in-app gallery for generated images.
- Detail screen with zoom, generation metadata, and sharing.
- Optional auto-save of results.
- Native platform save/share flows, including Android MediaStore and iOS Photos/share sheet where available.
- Export one image or the full gallery as a zip archive.

### Configure

- Provider setup from first launch or settings.
- Provider search, type/readiness/tag filters, and sorting for faster backend selection.
- Server URL and credentials for own-server providers.
- API keys for hosted providers.
- Local model selection and download flow for supported local diffusion providers.
- Runtime backend selectors for Android local providers where available, including SDXL Auto/CPU/OpenCL/Vulkan and Bonsai Auto/CPU/Vulkan.
- Hardware benchmark in AI Settings for local providers, including device score, acceleration availability, Android Bonsai Vulkan compute support, estimated generation time, and recommended local settings.
- Server availability monitoring for compatible own-server modes.
- Storage usage and network usage screens for gallery/cache/model files and provider traffic counters.

## Setup

### Option 1: SDAI Cloud

SDAI Cloud is the optional hosted provider available in official Google Play and App Store builds. It uses SDAI app tokens for generation, with top-ups through rewarded ads or in-app purchases where available. It is not included in the `full` or `foss` Android builds, and it is governed by the SDAI Cloud Terms of Service shown during setup.

### Option 2: AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI

Use this if you already run [Stable-Diffusion-WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) locally, on a server, or in a notebook environment.

1. Follow the setup instructions in the WebUI repository.
2. Start WebUI with API access enabled, for example with `--api --listen`.
3. Copy the reachable server URL.
4. Open SDAI setup, choose AUTOMATIC1111, enter the URL, and connect.

Demo mode is available from the setup screen if you want to explore the app without connecting to a real generator.

### Option 3: SwarmUI

Use this if your generation environment is powered by [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI). Start SwarmUI in server mode, copy the reachable URL, then choose SwarmUI during SDAI setup.

### Option 4: AI Horde

[AI Horde](https://stablehorde.net/) is a crowdsourced distributed cluster of image generation workers. SDAI can use the default anonymous key (`0000000000`) or your own key from [stablehorde.net/register](https://stablehorde.net/register).

### Option 5: Hugging Face Inference API

[Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) lets SDAI call hosted public or private image models. Create an API key in [Hugging Face account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then select the Hugging Face provider in SDAI.

### Option 6: OpenAI

OpenAI image generation in SDAI uses GPT Image models through the Images API. Create an API key in [OpenAI API key settings](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), then select OpenAI in SDAI.

### Option 7: Stability AI

[Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/) support uses the Stability image API. Create an API key on the [Stability AI keys page](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys), then select Stability AI and choose an engine in SDAI.

### Option 8: Fal.ai

[Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) support uses the Fal.ai queue API for compatible FLUX text-to-image and image-to-image endpoints. Create an API key in the [Fal.ai dashboard](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys), then select Fal.ai in SDAI and choose the endpoint from the shared generation form.

### Option 9: ArliAI

[ArliAI](https://www.arliai.com/quick-start) support uses the ArliAI SDNext-compatible image API. Create an ArliAI API key, select ArliAI in SDAI, connect, and choose the checkpoint from the shared generation form after model discovery completes.

### Option 10: Local Diffusion with Microsoft ONNX Runtime

Use this on Android for on-device txt2img generation. Download or provide a compatible ONNX local diffusion model, select it in setup, and generate without sending prompts to a remote service.

### Option 11: Local Diffusion with Google AI MediaPipe

Use this on Android for on-device txt2img generation through Google AI MediaPipe. This provider is available only in `playstore` and `full` Android flavors.

### Option 12: Local SDXL with stable-diffusion.cpp

Use this on Android for on-device SDXL-compatible txt2img generation through stable-diffusion.cpp. Download a supported model from the in-app SDXL catalog or provide a compatible local single-file model outside the Play build, then choose the runtime backend from Auto, CPU, OpenCL, or Vulkan. Mobile SDXL is memory-heavy, so the catalog starts with compact/quantized GGUF options such as SSD-1B / LCM-style models before larger desktop-class SDXL files.

### Option 13: Silicon Diffusion Core ML

Use this on iOS for on-device Stable Diffusion generation through Core ML. Download a supported Core ML model from the in-app catalog or import a compatible local model package, select it during setup, and generate without sending prompts or source images to a remote service.

The first-party catalog intentionally starts with Apple/Hugging Face Stable Diffusion 1.x and 2.x palettized Core ML archives. SDXL archives are not exposed by default until memory and execution-plan compatibility are stable across a tested device matrix.

### Option 14: PrismML Bonsai Image 4B

Use this for on-device text-to-image generation with PrismML Bonsai Image 4B. Download a supported Bonsai Ternary or Binary model archive from the in-app catalog, select it during setup, and generate without sending prompts to a remote service.

On iOS the provider is displayed as Silicon Diffusion PrismML Bonsai and uses the MLX runtime. On Android it is displayed as Local Diffusion PrismML Bonsai, uses the custom NDK/ART runtime, and exposes Auto, CPU, and Vulkan backend selection from the generation form.

iOS support is beta. Android support is experimental and device-sensitive: run the benchmark/setup checks before long generations, especially on low-RAM devices.

## Build Flavor Notes

Android flavor availability is driven by the Gradle flavor configuration and runtime provider filtering. Most network providers are available everywhere; Google AI MediaPipe is intentionally unavailable in `foss`. SDAI Cloud, AdMob, and in-app purchase integration are private optional modules included only in official Google Play builds, not in `full` or `foss`. Local SDXL through stable-diffusion.cpp and Local Diffusion PrismML Bonsai are available in `playstore`, `full`, and `foss`; their model catalogs are shared, and model files are downloaded or imported by the user rather than bundled into the app. The Play build avoids custom local model path selection for local diffusion models because broad file access is not generally accepted for Google Play distribution.

The iOS app is not split into Android-style flavors. The public code uses the shared mobile UI, remote-provider stack, Silicon Diffusion Core ML, and Silicon Diffusion PrismML Bonsai. The App Store build can additionally include the private optional SDAI Cloud, AdMob, and in-app purchase modules. Android ONNX, MediaPipe, SDXL, and Local Diffusion PrismML Bonsai local runtimes remain Android-specific.
